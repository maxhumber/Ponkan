Clementine is an open source iOS app and contrasting example to the *iOS Dev Tutorial* on [Transcribing Speech to Text](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/transcribing-speech-to-text).

Whereas the Apple tutorial uses DispatchQueue, Completion Handlers and sticks all of the logic directly onto the View 



Task, Async/Await, MVVM + CADI, 



What's in the name? I have a running joke with my partner that I'm not quite a Mandarin (speaker) yet, I'm still just a little "Clementine"!
