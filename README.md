### About

Hi, I'm Max! I made Ponkan to help me study Mandarin. *N«ê h«éo, w«í ji√†o Max! W«í zh√¨zu√≤ ‚ÄúPonkan‚Äù yƒ´nw√®i w«í y√†o xu√©x√≠ zh≈çngw√©n.* (Obviously, I still have a long way to go!)

Ponkan is a speech-to-text app that converts Mandarin Chinese to [Pinyin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pinyin), in real time<sup>‚Ä†</sup> The app is intended for beginners who like (and need) immediate feedback while practising in order to correct and improve pronunciation. 

I use Ponkan to practise my Mandarin in the same way that I use [MonkeyType](https://monkeytype.com/) to improve my typing.

### Design

Ponkan is a modern SwiftUI/MVVM app. Whereas the *iOS Dev Tutorial* on [Transcribing Speech to Text](https://developer.apple.com/tutorials/app-dev-training/transcribing-speech-to-text) uses `DispatchQueue` + completion handlers, and sticks all of the logic directly onto the View, Ponkan leverages `async/await` and is organized according to [CADI](https://github.com/maxhumber/BreadBuddy#%EF%B8%8F-cadi).



### Core

Ponkan is powered by the [Speech](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/speech) and [AVFoundation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/avfoundation) APIs. The core Ponkan [`TranscriptionService`](https://github.com/maxhumber/Ponkan/blob/master/Ponkan/Core/Sources/Core/Services/Transcription/TranscriptionService.swift) wraps and converts the output from `SFSpeechRecognizer` to an `AsyncThrowingStream` of strings which allows a ViewModel to manage and orchestrate speech recognition tasks...

The main `transcribe` method on the service looks like this:

```swift 
...    
    public func transcribe() -> AsyncThrowingStream<String, Error> {
        AsyncThrowingStream { continuation in
            var task: SFSpeechRecognitionTask?
            let onTermination = { task?.cancel() }
            continuation.onTermination = { @Sendable _ in onTermination() }
            task = recognizer.recognitionTask(with: request) { result, error in
                if error != nil { continuation.finish(throwing: error) }
                if result?.isFinal == true { continuation.finish() }
                let string = result?.bestTranscription.formattedString ?? ""
                continuation.yield(string)
            }
        }
    }
...
```

Which enables the ViewModel to capture output like this:

```swift
import Core

@MainActor final class ViewModel: ObservableObject {
    @Published var listening = false
    @Published var text = ""
  
    private let service = TranscriptionService(.mandarin)
    private var task: Task<Void, Never>?
  
    private func start() {
        listening = true
        task = Task(priority: .userInitiated) {
            do {
                try await service.start()
                for try await text in service.transcribe() {
                    self.text = text
                }
            } catch {
                stop()
            }
        }
    }
    
    private func stop() {
        listening = false 
        service.stop()
        task?.cancel()
        task = nil
    }
}
```



### üçä Name

I have a running joke with my partner that I'm not quite a Mandarin (speaker) yet, I'm still just a little clementine (in my abilities). Unfortunately, "Clementine" is already an app, so I had to settle for [ponkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ponkan), another type of small mandarin orange. While not my first choice, the name is growing on me!



### Disclaimer

<sup>‚Ä† While the Speech API provided by Apple‚Äîand used in this app‚Äîis¬†*pretty good*, it's not 100% perfect. So, if Ponkan isn't able to recognize 100% of your "100% perfect" pronunciation, you know who to blame! üòò</sup>
