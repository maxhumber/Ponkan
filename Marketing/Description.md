### Description

Ponkan is a speech-to-text app that converts Mandarin Chinese to Pinyin, in real time. 

The app is intended for beginners who like (and need) immediate feedback while practising in order to correct and improve pronunciation. 

Because Ponkan uses the on-device Speech Recognition APIs no data is collected or sent to any servers!
